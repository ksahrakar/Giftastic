A site to view popular gif's from Giphy API calls.
The site pulls animated Gifs with keywords from an API call. Four keywords are prefilled. Additional ones can be added by the user. Each keyword adds a button which can be clicked to reveal top 10 Gifs with that keyword.

The site is an exercise in API calls and dynamic HTML creation from Javascript.
